# Avalanche Testnet Validator

## Objective

Deploy, monitor, and operate a fully functional Avalanche Testnet (Fuji) Validator, maintaining uptime and earning full testnet rewards for one short cycle.

## Requirements

1. Deploy: Avalanche testnet validator (Dockerized or native) on AWS EC2.
2. Sync: Achieve and maintain full sync and peer connectivity.
3. Faucet: Obtain sufficient AVAX for fuji testnet purposes.
4. Validate: Once the node is fully synchronized, register it as a validator on fuji testnet.

## Automation:

Any scripts and setup documentation hosted on your personal GitHub.

## Monitoring:

Identify some key metrics a validator operator may be concerned with and document how to query this metric from the node.

## Constraints

1. Duration: 14 days (this is the smallest timeframe available on Avalanche, however, it will take less days to assess the challenge)
2. Access: SSH access to specified test machine
3. Network: Avalanche Fuji Testnet

## Deliverables:

1. Running healthy validator node on fuji testnet.
2. Provide the testnet explorer dashboard URL for the validator's statistics.
